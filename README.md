# DTSA5510 - Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers based on their **credit card usage behavior**. By analyzing spending patterns, installment preferences, and cash advance habits, we identify distinct customer groups that can help businesses tailor **marketing strategies, optimize credit offers, and improve customer engagement**.

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer spending behavior.
- **Data Preprocessing** including missing value handling and feature scaling.
- **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation.
- **Cluster Evaluation** using **Elbow Method & Silhouette Score**.
- **PCA Visualization** to interpret clusters.
- **Business Insights** for financial decision-making.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results & Insights
The model identified **four customer segments**:
1. **High Spenders with Large Credit Limits** â€“ Likely candidates for premium financial products.
2. **Low Activity Customers** â€“ Require engagement strategies to increase spending.
3. **Installment-Based Spenders** â€“ Prefer financing options for larger purchases.
4. **High Cash Advance Users** â€“ Potential signs of financial distress, needing risk assessment.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Clustering, PCA)
